# population_models

[This is a webpage that starts here.](https://jae0.github.io/population_models/)

It documents my excursions into various avenues of population modelling and the closely allied field of fisheries modelling, mostly for parameter estimation and prediction. It is meant to be a gentle introduction to new
students.
