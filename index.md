Population models are fundamental to understanding the past and future of
a population. 

There are many approaches. I will cover some that I have found to be useful.

For now, here is a list of some of the papers and reports that details some of these approaches I will delve into:

- [using cod as an indicator of environmental change](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.488963v4.article-metrics)
- [importance of environmental information in statistical estimation -- that is, random sampling is not as random as you would like](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.05.490753v3)
- [a continuous delay-differential model of a stage-structure population](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.13.528296v3)
- [discriminating habitat use differences of different stages and sexes of snow crab](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.20.520893v1)
- [overview of autocorrelation-based methods of statistical estimation problems](media/snowcrab_framework.pdf)
